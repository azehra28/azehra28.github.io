    <h2>New York City, USA</h2>
    <p>
      A college girls’ reunion turned into the perfect NYC weekend where we ate our way through the city, 
      went out dancing, and squeezed in as much exploring as possible, be it neighborhood walks, late night slices, 
      or subway rides. Short but packed, and exactly the reset we all needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Toronto & Mississauga, Canada</h2>
    <p>
      My best friend and I flew to meet our school friends from Pakistan for a five day catch up. 
      We soaked in the mist at Niagara Falls, 
      wandered downtown Toronto, hung out in Mississauga, and ate way too well. 
      It was all the comfort of home but with a new backdrop.
