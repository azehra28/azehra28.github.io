    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hi! I built this website to share more than just my professional life. Explore 
        the concerts that shaped my playlists, the foods I crave, the movies I adore, and 
        highlights from an eventful trip with my best friend.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="about-grid">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>I’m Aleena Zehra, an international student from Pakistan in my senior year,
             double-majoring in Psychology and Information Science with a minor in Computer Science.
              I’m a cybersecurity analyst-in-training, currently applying for full-time roles.
               Beyond the résumé, I love playing pickleball, baking, and sharing the little things that make me, me. 
               If you’d like the professional snapshot, you can find it on my 
               <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleena-zehra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>; 
               However, this site is where you’ll get to know me personally, through the concerts I’ve enjoyed, foods I
                adore, movies I recommend, and travel memories.</p>
