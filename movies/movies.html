    <h2>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (YJHD)</h2>
    <p>YJHD hits my sweet spot: friendships that feel real, travel that opens you up and exposes you the reality 
        of the world,
         and the
        tug of war between ambition and love. In my opinion, it’s cozy, colorful, and somehow always 
        energizing on a rewatch 
        (I have seen it 10 times at this point).</p>

        <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
        <p>The film balances wanderlust and home so well. Bunny’s drive to see the world mirrors my own pull 
            toward new challenges, while Naina’s grounded warmth reminds me why roots matter, even more 
            relatable living in a foreign country. 
            The music and friendships feel like real life. They are messy, funny, yet loyal no matter how 
            long it has been.</p>
